          <p>I am a PhD student at the University of Potsdam and at the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ in section 2.5 Geodynamic
            modeling. I develop numerical regional scale models of the Earth to better understand the mechanism behind the
            evolution of the surface and its deformation at convergent margins. In particular, my studies focus on the role of
            subduction dynamics and its interaction with the overriding plate. </p>


<p>I am also interested in developing new tools to simulate the active tectonics of the Earth. During my studies, I have
  created a code that calculates the coseismic contribution of earthquakes to the gravity field (the code is available
  upon request). Additionally, I have been involved in paleomagnetic studies, including measuring the Anisotropy of
  Magnetic Susceptibility to gain a deeper understanding of the mode of emplacement of plutons, as well as calculating
  paleomagnetic pole positions and discussing their implications for the closure age of the Mongol-Okhotsk ocean.</p>

    <p class="research_description">The subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American Plate has been active since at least 180
Ma. However, the cause of the initiation of the shortening of the Andes during less than last 50 My or less, and the
reasons behind the spatial and temporal variation in the magnitude of the shortening are still debated (Oncken et al.,
2012).

In the case of the Central Andes, the South American plate is advancing westwards forcing the trench to retreat and the
Nazca plate to roll-back. However, paleo-reconstructions of the margin position demonstrate that the trench velocity
slowed down over the last ~50 My and became lower than the South American plate velocity. This difference of velocity is
expressed by the shortening of the Andes. One reason for this decrease of velocity at the trench can be the anchoring of
the slab in the lower mantle (Faccenna et al., 2017). Although this hypothesis provides an explanation for the
initiation of shortening, it cannot explain the observed pulses of shortening (Oncken et al., 2012) as well as
latitudinal variations of its magnitude (~300 km at ~18-21&deg;S to ~100 km at 15&deg;S latitude) .

In central Andes, weakening mechanisms of the overriding plate (OP) such as lithospheric delamination have intensified
the tectonic shortening and contributed to formation of the Altiplano-Puna plateau (Sobolev et al., 2006). Moreover, the
difference in deformation style of the foreland basin, thick-skinned (e.g the Puna) and thin-skinned (e.g the
Altiplano), respectively, is correlated with variations in the magnitude of shortening. Nevertheless, the influence of
the strength variations in the OP on the subduction dynamics in the case of the central Andes has been poorly explored
so far. Our hypothesis is that OP strength variations result in variable rates of trench roll-back. To test this
hypothesis and in try to reproduce observed spatial and temporal variations of tectonic shortening in central Andes, we
have built an E-W-oriented 2D geodynamic model along the Altiplano-Puna plateau which incorporated the flat subduction
episode at ~35 Ma and following evolution of the lithospheric deformation. For that purpose, we used the FEM geodynamic
code ASPECT. The model is semi-dynamic, which means that the oceanic plate evolves dynamically (i.e. buoyancy-driven),
while the OP velocity is prescribed. Example of the model replicating deformation patterns and lithospheric structure at
latitude 21 &deg;S at present time is shown in Figure 1. We will discuss our new findings that demonstrate that not all key
factors driving orogeny in central Andes have been considered in modelling studies so far.</p>

<p class="research_description">GRACE Satellite (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) allows to measure monthly tiny variation of the terrestrial
gravity field since april 2002. These variations are due to mass redistribution and can come from hydrology (Glacial
melting, fluids circulation in groundwater), sedimentary (transport of sediments) and also seismic. The goal of this
study is to model the co-seismic gravimetric signal associated to the global seismicity recorded in the GCMT (Global
Centroid Moment Tensor) catalog on the observable time period of GRACE to finally correct it. This will give us access
to gravity signal of reduced amplitude. The co-seismic signal is modelled using seismic rupture parameters defined
either by model or by scaling law. A global cumulated co-seismic map of gravity variations between 2002 and 2014 is
calculated. Models are then compared to GRACE data from the Center for Space Research (CSR, Austin Texas). For high
magnitude (Mw&ge;8), similitude are shown between the model and gravity variations observed from GRACE. However for smaller
magnitude (Mw&lt;8) gravimetric effect is hardly verifiable.</p>

<p class="research_description">Indian topography is a key for our understanding of geodynamic processes. The kinematic of Indian plate as the formation
of the Himalaya mountain chain building are factors that allow to constrain models. Drifting of India is marked by many
events as microcontinents break up (e.g. Mascarene and Seychelles blocs) associated to wide basalt flow emplacement.
Thus basalt flow are really good markers to discuss about topographic evolution. The Main Deccan Traps province is one
of the best preserved LIP in the world. The basalt layers reach a maximum thickness off ~1800 on the western coast and
are gently inclined eastward (&lt;4&deg; inland) over a longwavelength (λ&gt; 500 km). The question of the process that could
cause this tilting is a lot debated and topographic evolution using paleoplanation surfaces approaches have already
been carry out by many authors (Gunnell 1998; Widdowson, 1997; Seth 2007). In our study, we used modeling using GIS to
propose an answer. We assume that most of the vertical motion was already achieved prior the monsoon impact (&gt;15Ma).
We have isolated the different major components of the topography ZElevation = ZDyn + ZIso + ZFlex+ ZErod (Becker et
al., 2014a). Results shows that inland erosion and unloading cannot explains the homogeneous uplift of the coast and
tilting. The long wavelenght tilting of the topography is not the consequence of the coastal erosion of the western
passive margin, unloading and its flexuration (Te = 10-13 km explains ~140 km inland). An effective elastic thickness
of Te = ~50 km-70 km fit with the central Deccan trapps topography. Two majors candidates are proposed : the first,
dynamic topography obtained by converting free-air gravity anomalies (Craig et al, 2011) shows slightly low
contribution over the trapps. This is verify by substrating all component estimated exept the dynamic topography to
the present topography (Becker et al., 2014). The second, isostatic topography is obtained considering buoyant
homogeneous crust over an homogeneous mantle lithosphere and mantle asthenosphere. The substraction of the isostatic
topography to the present topography produce a low residual topography implying that the major part of the topography
is attributed to isostasy. Therefore the the longwavelength tilting is caused by a thinning of the mantle lithosphere
under the Western Ghats Escarpement.</p>

<p class="research_description">The age of closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean has already been discussed for a long time. To better constrain its age
of closure, a study of the magnetic fabric and a paleomagnetic study have been carried on the Qitianling pluton during
this research project. Observations on the field show that the pluton didn’t undergone any visible deformation. Study on
the Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility confirms it. Analysis shows that an oblate shape and a horizontal foliation
are dominant, which could indicate that the pluton has not been tilted. Magnetites of pseudo-singledomain have been
recognized as the mineral carrier of the magnetic remanence. Progressive demagnetization carried on 131 samples, allow
us to isolate 2 directional magnetic components: one is the Low Temperature Component (CBT), close to the current value
of the geomagnetic field and one other is the High Temperature Component (CHT). Isolate directions of the high
temperature component show that the 3 granitic phases cannot be distinguished and have a weak rate of reverse (~16%).
U-Pb datations on zircons give an average age of 155 Ma (Zhu et al., 2009). These datations have measured the age at the
temperature of closure of their isotopic system at 850&deg;C. Magnetite gets its magnetic remanence at 580°C. A cooling of
50&deg;C/Ma compatible with the rate of reversal geomagnetic field shows that the age of acquisition of the magnetic
remanence by the pluton could be estimated around 150 Ma. The compatibility of the paleomagnetic direction allow us to
calculate an average direction (CHT), and transform it in a paleomagnetic pole of the South China Block (SCB) of 150 M
a: 84,1&deg;N, 192,9&deg;E and &alpha;95=7,3. By comparing this paleomagnetic pole with those from the North China Block (NCB) and
from Siberia, results indicate that NCB and SCB was already stuck together and considered as a single block. This single
block had a relative displacement of 1300±800 km in paleolatitude with the Siberia block for 150 Ma. This value
indicates that the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean was still opened to the Upper Jurassic with a minimum width of ~500 km. This
result contrasts with the previous studies which have estimated a width of ~1500km (Enkin et al., 1992) or ~3000km (Pei
et al., 2011).</p>
